        The world owes much to Henrietta Lacks. Henrietta Lacks was an African American woman whose cells were
        removed during a biopsy in 1951 — and used for research without her knowledge or approval. A few months after
        Henrietta’s diagnosis of cervical cancer, she died at the age of 31 years old. She never would know that more than
        six decades later, her cells would continue to grow and provide a foundation for advancements in science and
        medicine.
        Henrietta’s cells revolutionized the ﬁeld of medicine. Her amazing and immortal cells (commonly known as HeLa
        cells) have been used for decades in biomedical research - to study cancer, the effects of radiation, and AIDS —
        among many other areas. Her cells led to the development of successful drugs in ﬁghting human diseases, such
        as leukemia, hemophilia, herpes, human papillomavirus (HPV), Parkinson’s disease, and inﬂuenza, among others.

      <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Henrietta Lacks's life:</h3>
      <li><strong>1920</strong> - Henrietta Lacks was born Loretta Pleasant on August 1, 1920, in Roanoke, Virginia to Eliza and Johnny Pleasant.</li>
      <li><strong>1941</strong> - On April 10, 1941, Henrietta Pleasant married David “Day” Lacks.</li>
      <li><strong>1951</strong> - Henrietta Lack died of cancer at the age of 31. A biopsy of her tumor was taken and sent to the lab of Dr. George Gey resulting in the creation of HeLa cell line.</li>
      <li><strong>1952</strong> - Scientists used HeLa cells to help develop the polio vaccine.</li>
      <li><strong>1973</strong> - Scientists used HeLa cells to study the behavior of salmonella inside human cells.</li>
      <li><strong>1984</strong> - HeLa cells were used by a German virologist to help prove that the human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cancer.</li>
      <li><strong>1986</strong> - The virus infection mechanism of HIV was studied by scientists who infected HeLa cells with HIV.</li>
      <li><strong>1993</strong> - HeLa cells were used to study tuberculosis.</li>
      <li><strong>2013</strong> - On August 6, 2013, the NIH announced an agreement with the family of Henrietta Lacks allow biomedical researchers controlled access to the whole genome data of HeLa cells.
